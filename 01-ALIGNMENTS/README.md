### cnid_hox_plus.fa
Homeobox sequences from cnidarian transcriptomes plus previously published bilaterian and cnidarian Hox and Hox-related sequences

### all_hox_plus.fa_wholeSeqs
cnid_hox_plus.fa after sequences with five or more gaps have been removed

### subalign
all_hox_plus.fa_wholeSeqs after pruning sequences outside the clade defined by N. vectensis, with cloned C. xamachana sequences that had been removed for gaps added

### subalign2
subalign after an additional pruning step, again removing sequences outside the N. vectensis-defined clade; some sequence names have also been shortened
